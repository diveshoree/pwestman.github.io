		<p><b>Power Up Milestone</b></p>
		<p>This week I will be showing a demo of my powered up PCB. The PCB is connected to the GPIO header on my Raspberry Pi. It has an LED light, a temperature sensor, and a light sensor. </p>

	 <H3>Is the Project Reproducible by Following These Instructions?</H3>
	 <p>So far I am on track with the activities for the project versus the schedule. I have completed the soldering of the components onto the PCB and I am ready to test to see if the connections are vaild. The current mechanical assembly milestone is complete and ready for the power up milestone next week. Some problems that I encountered was acquiring parts that would not take months to be shipped from overseas or that would not be an additional $50 for shipping to get here sooner. To solve this problem I have found that DigiKey will ship overnight and does not cost a fortune to send. The parts that I will still need to acquire are the IR obstacle avoidance sensor and the IR thermometer for inside the hive. The digital scale was ordered and has arrived. It cost a total of $22.99 plus tax, which came in right at our budget of $25. Financially, the project is on track as almost all components have been acquired and I am still under my projected budget.</p>
	 
	 <p>This is a picture of the completely soldered PCB. The PCB has yet to be tested and might need some touch ups on the soldering job.</p>
