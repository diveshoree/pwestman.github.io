		<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
		<p>The purpose of the Bee Tracker project is to keep an accurate count of the number of bees in the hive at any time. This is done by IR Optical Interrupter modules that are mounted on either side of an acrylic gate at various entrance holes that is mounted in front of the entrance to the bee hive. This way, any time a bee enters or leaves the hive, it will be recorded. This is done by mounting the sensors on either side of the gate and checking if the first sensor detects an interruption followed by the second. This would indicate an entry and a counter would be incremented. If the sensors detected an interruption in the opposite order, this would indicate an exit and decrement the counter.</p>
